## 7 Principles of AI Developer Products

### Principle 1: Start with what developers know
- Encourage transition from existing interfaces
- Easy switch between code and natural language

### Principle 2: Configuration flexibility
- **Zero setup**: demonstrate value immediately
- **Seamless model switching**
- **Great configurability** for power users

### Principle 3: Focus on developer ergonomics
- Saving a single keystroke is worth it
- Zero onboarding friction

### Principle 4: Chat as a first-class citizen
- Code is representation of human intent
- Evolution toward natural language

### Principle 5: MCP Integration
- MCP became de facto standard
- Extensible tool ecosystem

### Principle 6: Rapid feedback loops
- Iterate and see updates quickly
- Explainability is first-class citizen

### Principle 7: Agent Workflows
- Full autonomy for substantive tasks
- Varied human-in-the-loop levels
