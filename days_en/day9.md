# Day 9: Agents Post-Deployment - AI DevOps

## Course Overview

> "Monitoring software systems in production remains mission-critical"

Coding accounts for only 30% of engineering time. The harder 70% is running code.

## 1. Traditional SRE Responsibilities

| Responsibility |
|----------------|
| Operational monitoring |
| Incident resolution |
| Maintaining runbooks |
| On-call burnout |

---

## 2. Four Golden Monitoring Signals

| Signal |
|--------|
| Latency |
| Errors |
| Traffic |
| Saturation |

---

## 3. Incident Response Playbook

```
1. Acknowledge and assess
2. Check DB + app
3. Identify recent changes
4. Localize blast radius
5. Execute mitigations
6. Stabilize + monitor
7. Communicate
8. Document
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric |
|--------|
| MTTR |
| Engineers pulled in |
| SLA |

- Real-time narratives
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation recommendations

---

## 5. AI SRE Limitations

- Limited incident complexity
- Production stack heterogeneity
- Monitoring gardening
